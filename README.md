My Learnings:
📊 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted in-depth analysis of customer attributes such as age, salary, and work experience to understand behavior and preferences. Identified patterns, correlations, and outliers that could influence the choice of preferred mode of transport. ⚙️ 2. Data Preprocessing & Customer Profiling: Cleaned and transformed raw data for modeling using: Label encoding, feature scaling, and handling missing values Built customer profiles by analyzing lifestyle and economic traits to improve model interpretability and real-world application. 🧠 3. Ensemble Machine Learning Techniques: Gained hands-on experience with various ensemble classifiers, including: Bagging Techniques – e.g., Random Forest to reduce variance Boosting Techniques – AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost to improve model accuracy Stacking Classifier – to combine the strengths of multiple base models 🔧 4. Model Optimization & Evaluation: Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance. Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to select the best-performing model. 🧾 5. Text Mining (if applicable in dataset): Applied basic text processing techniques to extract features from any textual data (if present). Learned the significance of feature extraction and its impact on prediction when non-numeric data is included. 📈 6. Business Application: Built a predictive model capable of forecasting the preferred mode of transport for potential clients based on their demographic and professional data. Provided actionable insights that could help in targeted marketing, policy planning, and transport infrastructure optimization. 💡 Overall Takeaway: Learned how to apply advanced ensemble ML techniques to solve real-world classification problems. This project deepened my skills in model building, tuning, and interpretation, while enhancing your ability to derive actionable insights from structured and semi-structured data for business decision-making.
